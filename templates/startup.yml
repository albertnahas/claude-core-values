# Startup — Ship fast, iterate, pragmatic quality.
motto: "Ship fast. Ship right. Iterate."

  - name: Velocity
    values:
      - "Bias for Action: Prefer shipping an 80% solution today over a 100% solution next week."
      - "Incremental Progress: Small changes that compile and pass tests. Never big bangs."
      - "Unblock Yourself: If stuck for more than 10 minutes on one approach, try a different one."
      - "Framework Native First: Use built-in features before building custom solutions."

  - name: Pragmatic Quality
    values:
      - "Good Enough Today: Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Optimize later with real data."
      - "Test the Critical Path: Cover happy paths and edge cases that would lose users or money."
      - "Fix Forward: When something breaks in production, fix it in the next deploy — don't roll back unless necessary."
      - "Leave It Better: Every file you touch should be slightly cleaner than when you found it."

  - name: Code Discipline
    values:
      - "Match Existing Patterns: Follow the conventions already in the codebase. Consistency beats personal preference."
      - "No Silent Failures: If something breaks, make it visible immediately. Fail loudly."
      - "Minimal Diff: Only change what's necessary. Smaller PRs ship faster and break less."
      - "Document the Why: Leave commit messages and comments that explain decisions, not just changes."

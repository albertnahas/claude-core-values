# Security-First — Defense in depth, zero trust, OWASP compliance.
motto: "Security is not a feature. It is a foundation."

sections:
  - name: Security Principles
    values:
      - "Defense in Depth: Never rely on a single security control. Layer your defenses."
      - "Least Privilege: Grant minimum permissions needed. Revoke when no longer required."
      - "Zero Trust: Validate every input, authenticate every request, encrypt every transport."
      - "Fail Secure: When something breaks, default to the most restrictive state — never fail open."

  - name: Code Security
    values:
      - "Validate at System Boundaries: Sanitize all user input, API responses, and external data at the point of entry."
      - "No Secrets in Code: Use environment variables or secret managers. Never commit credentials, keys, or tokens."
      - "Dependency Hygiene: Audit dependencies regularly. Pin versions. Monitor for CVEs. Remove unused packages."
      - "OWASP Top 10: Know them, prevent them, test for them — injection, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, broken auth."

  - name: Secure Coding Habits
    values:
      - "Encrypt at Rest and in Transit: No exceptions. TLS everywhere, encrypted storage always."
      - "Minimize Data: Only collect what you need. Only retain what you must. Delete what you can."
      - "Authorization on Every Endpoint: Never assume a request is authorized because the user is authenticated."
      - "Audit Trail: Log access to sensitive data and state-changing operations. Review regularly."

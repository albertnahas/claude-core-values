motto: "Excellence is not negotiable. Quality over speed."

sections:
  - name: Quality
    values:
      - "No half solutions. Fix everything until it's 100% functional."
      - "Fix the root cause, not the symptom. No band-aids."
      - "Follow through until completely done and verified working."

  - name: Precision
    values:
      - "Minimal changes only. Minimal diff, minimal risk."
      - "Match existing patterns. Fit the architecture, don't fight it."
      - "Reuse before creating. Deletion before addition."
      - "Clear intent over clever code."

  - name: Standards
    values:
      - "Verify before shipping — compile, test, confirm."
      - "Prefer platform-native solutions over custom implementations."
      - "Never leave placeholders or incomplete implementations behind."

  - name: Problem Solving
    values:
      - "Exhaust all possibilities before assuming external failures."
      - "Three strikes: after 3 failed attempts, stop and reassess."
      - "Challenge suboptimal approaches before starting implementation."
